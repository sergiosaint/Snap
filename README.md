# Snap

## Coding Exercise
In C#, write a simulator that models the popular ‘Snap’ card game. Your simulator should model a
game between several players and output information about the state of the game to the console.
No significant user interaction or user interface is required. It’s beyond the scope of this work to
write a fully interactive snap game!

**A definition of the Snap game follows:**

A standard pack of 52 cards is shuffled and then dealt out equally among the players in
face-down stacks (any remaining cards are discarded). Play proceeds with the players
taking it in turns to remove a card from the top of their stack and place it face-up on a
central pile. If two cards placed consecutively on the pile have the same number value
(e.g. 2 queens) then players must shout "Snap!" and place their hand on the top of the
central pile. The first player who "snaps" the cards takes the cards from the central pile
and adds them to the bottom of their own stack. The player who accumulates all of the
cards in this way wins the game.

### Your solution:
- should follow good design and coding best practices. Be aware that these will be discussed
in the next stage of the interview process.
- should include a couple of unit tests. Some good candidates could be the shuffling of cards
and the dealing of cards to the players. The aim here isn’t to provide a full test suite, but to
demonstrate your ability to write tests. You can pick whichever unit testing framework you
are comfortable with (NUnit, XUnit, MSpec...).
- should, if possible, target .NET 4.5.1 and build in Visual Studio 2013*

. If it doesn’t, please

indicate which version of .NET and Visual Studio you used.
- can include third-party libraries from NuGet.
You can submit your solution via a repository of your choice (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc) or send it to us
via email in a .zip file. We will provide you with feedback on your solution and where appropriate
will invite you to a further face to face interview. At this interview we will ask you to discuss your
design choices and the coding practices you followed.
We appreciate that this exercise will take up some of your time and thank you for making time for
us.
Good luck!
